Once you open the Index file in your browser you will see that we have several tests.

### RSS Feeds

- Test two will iterate through each feed and check that they have a correct url.
- Test three will chake that each feed has a title.

### The menu

- Test one will check that the menu is hidden by default
- Test two will check that the menu will appear and dissapear by clickin in the menu icon.  

### Initial Entries

- The test will check that when the function that loads feeds is done, there should be at least 1 entry.

### New Feed Selection
